# LeetCode Study Log with Java

## About This Project

This repository is my personal log for documenting solutions and approaches to coding challenges on Leetcode. It is a reflection of my continuous learning and problem-solving journey, capturing insights and progress using Java 17.

### Progress Update as of November 7, 2023

I approach my LeetCode studies by focusing on one category at a time. To keep things straightforward, I've organized my progress log based on difficulty levels:

Easy Problems Solved: 22
Medium Problems Solved: 6
Hard Problems Solved: 2
I'll keep this section updated as I progress through my problem-solving journey.
